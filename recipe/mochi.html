<p>We are going to learn how to do one of the most traditional desserts in Japan</p>
<p><em><h2>Ingredients</h2></em></p>
<p><em><h4>For The Mochi</h4></em></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Glutinous Rice Flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup Water</li>
    <li>1/3 cur Cornstarch</li>
    <li>12 Strawberries</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Beet and Hibiscus powder, dissolved in 2 teaspoons Water</li>
    
</ul>
<p><em><h4>For The Bean Paste</h4></em></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 cans White Kidney Beans (15 ounce)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
    <li> 3 tablespoons Rice Malt Syrup</li>
</ul>
<p><em><h2>Instructions</h2></em></p>
<p><em><h4>Make The Bean Paste:</h4></em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Press the beans through a fine strainer to get a very smooth texture. Transfer to a pan with sugar. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. As the paste is heated and sugar is dissolved, the paste will become loose. Add rice syrup, continue stirring all around so that steam gets out and the paste thickens again. Continue cooking until water has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, allow to cool down. Flatten paste and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.</li>

<p><em><h4>Make The Mochi:</h4></em></p>

    <li>Combine the rice flour and sugar in a microwave-proof bowl. Add water and mix until combined. Microwave for 1 minute, stir, then microwave for 1 more minute. Stir, then heat again for 30 seconds. Mix in the beet and hibiscus powder, stirring until it thickens and comes together.</li>
    <p><li>Flour work surface with cornstarch. Put the mochi on top and cut into 12 pieces. Flatten the mochi into a circle (use more cornstarch if needed).</li></p>
    <p><li>Wrap the strawberries with bean paste. Put some cornstarch on your hands. Place flattened mochi dough and put the covered strawberry on top of it (with the tip facing down). Wrap it and pinch the bottom closed.</li></p>
</ol>
